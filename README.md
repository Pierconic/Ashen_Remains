Replaces vanilla fire with a new and improved, (admittedly somewhat slower) system, in which fire spread is determined by random tick rather than constant updates, which can cause lag. Vanilla fire tick is disabled, and vanilla flint and steel produces modded fire, which produces ash and a new charred wood variant; which is more durable than regular wood, but disintegrates in water or rain. 
In addition, adds a new regrowth system: following fires, rain eventually washes away ash and charred wood, and a new Flowering Grass block gradually spreads new flora based on the biome; repopulating grass, flowers, and saplings. Several minor tweaks to how fireballs, mob griefing, and tree growth work are also included.
